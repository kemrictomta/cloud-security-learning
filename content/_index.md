Hi 👋 I’m Kemric.  
I document my progress in **Cloud** and **Cybersecurity** through **hands-on labs**, short writeups, and small projects.

I start with a static learning page, and once I have a clear security objective, I build a minimal infrastructure to support it.

---

## Start here
- **Learning** → roadmap, current focus, labs, and projects  
- **Stack** → tools and workflow I use  
- **Case Study** → sanitized professional project (Python, Neo4j/Cypher, Docker)  
- **Posts** → short notes and lab writeups  

---

## What I’m working on right now
- Cloud: IAM + VPC basics  
- Security: recon fundamentals + OWASP mindset  
- DevOps: repeatable workflows with Docker + GitHub Actions  

---

## Featured learning tracks
### Cloud
- IAM, networking fundamentals, logging, Terraform

### Security
- Networking basics, recon, web security fundamentals, detection basics

### DevOps
- Docker, CI/CD, automation, and (later) Kubernetes basics
