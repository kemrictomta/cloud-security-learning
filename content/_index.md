I’m documenting my learning journey in **Cloud** and **Cybersecurity** through hands-on labs, short writeups, and small projects.

I already have a strong engineering background (Python, Docker, graph data / Neo4j & Cypher). This site is where I turn that experience into a focused **cloud + security** skillset — with evidence, not hype.

* * *

## What I’m building here

- A clear learning roadmap (what I’m learning now, next, and why)
- Repeatable labs (steps, notes, outcomes)
- Small projects with deliverables (repo, diagram, writeup)
- A sanitized professional case study (real-world work, NDA-safe)

* * *

## How I learn

**Learn by building.** I don’t just read— I implement, break things, fix them, and document the result.  
**Document everything.** If it’s not written down, it didn’t happen.  
**Minimal infrastructure.** I only build infra when it supports a clear security objective.

## Start here

- **Learning:** `/pages/learning/`
- **Stack:** `/pages/stack/`
- **Case Study:** `/pages/case-study/`
- **Posts:** `/posts/`

> “Ship ugly, iterate fast.”  
That’s the plan.
