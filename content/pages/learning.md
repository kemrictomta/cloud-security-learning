title: "Security & Cloud Learning"
date: 2026-01-11
draft: false
---

I document my learning journey in **cloud** and **cybersecurity** through **hands-on labs**, short writeups, and small projects.  
I start with a static learning page, and once I have a clear security objective, I build a minimal infrastructure to support it.

---

## Now
**Focus (this month)**
- Cloud: IAM + Networking (VPC, routing, DNS, TLS basics)
- Security: recon fundamentals + web basics (OWASP mindset)
- DevOps: Docker + CI habits (repeatability)

**Weekly routine**
- 2 labs/week → 1 short writeup
- 1 concept/week → summary notes + links
- 1 mini-project/month → documented deliverables

---

## Roadmap
### Cloud Foundations
- [ ] AWS basics: IAM, EC2, S3
- [ ] Networking: VPC, subnets, routing, security groups
- [ ] Logging: CloudTrail / CloudWatch basics
- [ ] IaC: Terraform fundamentals

### DevOps Foundations
- [ ] Git: clean commits, branching, README discipline
- [ ] Docker: build/run, images, volumes, networking
- [ ] CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint → build → deploy)
- [ ] Kubernetes basics (later): k3s/minikube, pods, services

### Security Foundations
- [ ] Networking basics: DNS, TLS, HTTP, common ports
- [ ] Linux basics: permissions, services, logs
- [ ] Recon: Nmap, basic enumeration, threat thinking
- [ ] Web basics: OWASP Top 10 concepts
- [ ] Detection basics (later): logs → alerts → dashboards

---

## Tools I Use
### Cloud & DevOps
- Git + GitHub
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- Terraform (in progress)

### Security
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Burp Suite (learning)
- Linux (Ubuntu/Kali labs)

---

## Labs & Writeups
### Completed
- ✅ (add your first lab here)

### In progress
- ⏳ (add the lab you’re doing now)

### Next
- ⏭️ (what you will do next)

---

## Projects
### 1) Secure Cloud Baseline (planned)
**Goal:** minimal secure baseline (IAM + logging + network basics).  
**Deliverables:**
- Terraform repo
- architecture diagram
- short writeup (“what I built and why”)

### 2) Detection Starter Pack (planned)
**Goal:** collect logs and build basic detection rules.  
**Deliverables:**
- dashboards / alerts
- writeup + screenshots

---

## Professional Case Study
I also documented a sanitized professional project that introduced me to **Python**, **Neo4j/Cypher**, and **Docker**.
