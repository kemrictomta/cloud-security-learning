This page lists the tools and services I use for cloud, security, and hands-on learning.

## Core Tools
### DevOps & Cloud
- Git + GitHub
- Docker
- Terraform
- (AWS/Azure/GCP — in progress)

### Security
- Wireshark
- Nmap
- Burp Suite
- (SIEM tooling planned)

## Workflow
- Notes → short writeups
- Labs → repeatable steps
- Projects → minimal infrastructure only when it supports a clear security objective
